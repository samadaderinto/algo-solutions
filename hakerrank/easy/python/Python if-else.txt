Question  

   Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

    If n is odd, print Weird
    If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print "Not Weird"
    If n is even and in the inclusive range of  to 6 to 20, print "Weird"
    If n is even and greater than 20, print "Not Weird"

    Input Format:

       A single line containing a positive integer, n.  

    Constraints:
          
       1 <= n <= 100

    Output Format:
    
       Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

    Sample Input 0:

       3
    
    Sample Output 0:

       Weird
    
    Sample Input 1:

       24

    Sample Output 1:

       Not Weird
 

Solutions

    Python 3

      Step 1: create if else statement
      Step 2: create condition that checks if number is odd (n % 2 == 1,e.g 15 modulo 2 = 7 remainder 1, which is the answer)
      Step 3: print("Weird")
      Step 4: create condition that checks if number is even (n % 2 == 0,e.g 14 modulo 2 = 7 remainder 0, which is the answer) and checks if n is > 2 and n is <= 5
      Step 5: print("Not Weird")
      Step 6: create condition that checks if number is even (n % 2 == 0,e.g 14 modulo 2 = 7 remainder 0, which is the answer) and checks if n is > 6 and n is <= 20
      Step 7: print("Weird")
      Step 8: create else block and print("Not Weird")
